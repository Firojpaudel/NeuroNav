## Requirements  
Before starting, you will need an **EEG device**. During the prototyping phase, we are using the [**Emotiv Insight - 5 Channel Wireless Headset**](https://www.emotiv.com/products/insight?srsltid=AfmBOopN_QupTxPK9dfEW_cCYjIWL1tp7jPZ8pBb_wfrTzAFbccASd-c). While this is a high-end device, we plan to use more affordable versions in the final stages of development. For now, we are making it work with the equipment available.
